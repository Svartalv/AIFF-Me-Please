# Required dependency for running the app
# FORCED old version for macOS 14.6 compatibility
# Use --no-deps to avoid pulling in incompatible dependencies
mutagen==1.45.1

# Note: Pillow is NOT included - it causes macOS version compatibility issues
# The app works perfectly without Pillow (icon won't display, but all features work)

# Build dependencies (only needed if building standalone app):
# PyInstaller is NOT in requirements.txt - install it separately if needed:
# pip3 install --user pyinstaller
