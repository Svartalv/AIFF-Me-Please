# FFmpeg Binary

This directory should contain the `ffmpeg` binary for macOS.

## Obtaining FFmpeg

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
# Then copy the binary:
cp /opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg resources/ffmpeg/ffmpeg
# Or for Intel Macs:
cp /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg resources/ffmpeg/ffmpeg
```

### Option 2: Static Build
Download a static build from:
- https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ (macOS builds)

Place the `ffmpeg` binary in this directory.

### Option 3: Build from Source
Build ffmpeg from source and copy the binary here.

## Notes

- The binary must be executable: `chmod +x resources/ffmpeg/ffmpeg`
- For PyInstaller, the binary will be bundled automatically if it's in this location
- The app will fall back to system `ffmpeg` if the bundled version is not found
